# Countries with AXIOS & REACT-ROUTER V6

[See the page](https://countries-react-router.vercel.app/)

- I made a multipage website with <b>React Router v6</b>.  
- When user open the site the home page will show regions. I get the data from [restcountriesAPI](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all).
- After clicking one of the regions router will direct user to this specific regions page. In this page there will be countries which belong to this region.
- Again when user clicks on one of the country card router will direct user to this countries page.  
- Also I created a <b>Navbar</b> component to display in every single page.
- There are more... You can visit the site.

### I used;
  - <b>Components</b>
  - <b>useState</b>
  - <b>useEffect</b>
  - <b>axios</b>
  - <b>React-Router-DOM <i>( Outlet, Link, NavLink, isActive )</i>></b>
   - <b>useParams</b>
  - import/export
  - <b>Props</b>
  - React <b>Developer Tool</b>
  - Destructuring props
  - array <b>map</b> method
  - array <b>find</b> method
